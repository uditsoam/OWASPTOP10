# OWASP A01 — Broken Access Control (Writeups & Guidance)

## Overview
This repository contains detailed writeups and practical guidance on **OWASP A01: Broken Access Control**. Broken access control occurs when an application fails to enforce who can access or perform actions on resources — allowing users to access data or functionality outside their permissions.

> NOTE: This content is educational. Only test on systems you own or where you have explicit permission.

## Contents
- `explanations/` — conceptual explanations and diagrams
- `examples/` — safe, illustrative (non-exploitable) examples demonstrating common patterns (IDOR, forced browsing, token issues)
- `detection/` — manual and automated testing checklists
- `mitigations/` — recommended fixes, code snippets, and configuration tips
- `references.md` — links to OWASP and other authoritative resources

## Common Patterns
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Horizontal & vertical privilege escalation
- Missing server-side authorization checks
- Metadata or token manipulation
- Forced browsing / unprotected endpoints

## Detection & Testing (high-level)
- Perform role-based tests (user, admin, unauthenticated)
- Attempt non-sequential object ID access (example: change `/orders/1001` → `/orders/1002`) on *systems you own*
- Review server-side authorization logic and middleware
- Add authorization tests to CI

## Mitigations (high-level)
- Enforce server-side authorization on every request (deny by default)
- Centralize access-control logic and use RBAC/ABAC
- Use opaque references or verify ownership for objects
- Strictly validate tokens (signatures, claims, expiry)
- Log and monitor authorization failures

## Responsible disclosure
Do not attempt to exploit real systems without permission. If you find a vulnerability in someone else’s system, follow their security disclosure policy or contact them responsibly.
